             <div class="span8"><p>flyUtils is intended to be a bunch of web-apps that would aid fly researchers in many routine tasks. And this is completely open source, hosted at github (<a href="https://github.com/roastedneutrons/FlyCross">https://github.com/roastedneutrons/FlyCross</a>). </p>
             <p><b>singleCross</b> is meant for analyzing single-step drosophila crosses. The app is intended for both newcomers to fly research, and for experienced fly pushers. (However, it assumes the user is acquainted with standard drosophila nomenclature). When you are setting up crosses with multiple markers on different chromosomes, drawing a punnett square and figuring out phenotype clashes is a pain to do on pen and paper. This tool is intended to help in such situations.</p>
             <p><b>Features in the pipeline:</b><br/>
             <ul>
               <li>Yield percentage of each progeny: Useful in multi-step crosses, if you have multiple genotypes that work for you, and want to know quickly </li>
               <li>Markers to screen for: Info about which markers have to be screened to isolate your progeny from the rest of the population. Although this is easy to figure out from your cross, manually, its nice if everything you want is displayed in one place.</li>
               <li>A proper fly-work API, so that other programs can easily interface with this.</li>
               <li>Easier specification of constraints: Right now constraints have to be typed in. Some might find this annoying. So an optional way of clicking genes on the displayed genotype to specify constraints would be handy. </li>
               <li>Auto-filling the constraints, balancers and markers, by extracting data from FlyBase</li>
             </ul>
               <p>If you have anything you want to be added to this pipeline, or some problems with the existing one, please use the link for the feedback form the navigation bars on top</p>

             <p>Konstrui is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">esperanto</a> for 'build'. Konstrui intends to build machines and software to help aid research. We also host an open hackerspace, so that folks can come and construct whatever D-I-Y stuff they dream of. Both of these though are still are a work-in-progress. Use the feedback link in case you want to get in touch to participate in any way. </p>
